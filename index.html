    <h1 class="bio">Career</h1>
    <h4 class="para">
      After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).
      He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
      Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.
      In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.
      In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
